This project was developed as a module coursework.

Thanks to Stamatis Kourkotas from

**Imperial College London:** MSc in Computing (Software Engineering)<br />
**Module:** Principless of Distributed Ledgers<br />
**Project Description:** Found in included [report](./report.pdf)<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps for deployment and use of our DApp

- Firstly, deploy our smart contract found in src/project.eth.sol. We tested this locally on a private blockchain using [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- In the main file of our user interface src/App.tsx specify the address where you deployed the contract in the constant CONTRACT_ADDRESS.
- Install the [metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension on your browser to handle your provate blockchain account. The project has been tested with the Chrome and Mozilla browsers.
- In the project directory run:

    **`npm install`** This installs all the necessary dependencies to build our application
    
    **`npm start`** This runs the app in development mode.<br />

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You can see all the Creatures owned by the current metamask account and play the game.
